# JAVA Home App
## Totally Not Necessarily Usefull
### Seriously, this is just a progress tracking type of project

Do feel free to comment or give hints 
or pointers, any help is more than
appreciated.

This is basically a collection of 
any problem I find interesting enough
to solve and isn't directly tied to 
any class or course. Likely to be an
eyebleed to experienced devs.
